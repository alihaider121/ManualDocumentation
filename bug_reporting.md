**Description:**
When a parent is booking a session for the child with the Tutor, the Appointment Booked email is showing the session booked by Parent

But, when the Tutor is creating a session for a parent's child, the Appointment Booked email is still showing the session booked by Parent

As per my understanding, when the Tutor is booking/ creating a session for the Parent's child, the Appointment Booked email should show that the session is booked by Tutor i-e email and details of the tutor should be displayed - And when the parent is booking a session then the parent details should be displayed against booked by

**Steps to create:**
Login as Tutor
Create a session for a Parent's child
Check the email from the parent inbox
Login as Parent
Create a session for a Parent's child
Check the email from the parent inbox

**Expected Result:**
Session booked by the Tutor should display the tutor details in the booked by information section

**Actual Result:**
For booking done by Parent, the Booked by details are displayed for the Parent which is correct
For booking done by Tutor, the Booked by details are displayed for the Parent which is incorrect
